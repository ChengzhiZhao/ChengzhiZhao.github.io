> Do you want to pay only $15 as person for your wireless bill each month? If "Yes", please keep reading.

[Mint Mobile](https://www.mintmobile.com/) intially starts on August 1, 2016. It started gaining massive attraction during the Super Bowl commercial in 2018 with a "green fox" talking about saving money on cellphone plan with only $20 a month.

## Initial Thoughts
At the time of writing this article, assume you only want to pay for a single line, you'd see the following price from major carriers. You can get even lower price if you are in a family plan with multiple people, so it is something we need to take into consideration compared with Mint Mobile. Note: the price below gives you unlimited talk, text & data.

        |  AT&T  | Verizon | T-Mobile | Sprint |
        |:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|
        | $65/mo  | $70/mo   | $60/mo   | $60/mo  |

At first glance, Mint Mobile's plans are very competitive on the price. Although users have to plan on how much data they would need beforehand (Mint Mobile is not unlimited on 4G), it's still sounds like a good deal from the money perspective. 

Secondly, users pay their contract fee upfront with Mint Mobile, it feels like prepaid monthly plan. There are 9 options available now: 3, 6 and 12 months, each month you can choose 3G, 8G and 12G as 4G data plan, both talks and text are unlimited, the longer period you have the less monthly cost you pay. With a winter (Black Friday) deal, you could get your first 3 months with 12G data as low as $15/month. After 3 month "welcome" contract period, you can choose close the account, change plan or continue with the current plan. Despite the plan you choose, at the beginning of each plan cycle, you pay for entire contract instead of a monthly installment. For example, you choose a 12 month plan, you'd need to pay for the entire year, which could be a burden compare to other wireless carriers.

Thirdly, as a wireless provider, signal is one of the biggest factors needs to take careful consideration. Mint Mobile is powered by T-Mobile's 4G LTE network, how good is that? It depends where you go but overall I am happy with my experience.

At last, Mint Mobile doesn't sell your phone with their plan, it is called **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**, which means you'd need to bring an unlock phone yourself. If you are not sure if your phone is unlock, please check your current wireless provider before make the purchase.

Since I need to purchase a cheap phone plan for less than 6 months, I'd give Mint Mobile a try, below is my review with 7 days experience. 

## Ordering & Unboxing Process
I had a very good experience with their website and order process is straightforward, they also take the shipping cost away due to the deal which is very nice. I paid chose the $15/month for first 3 months with 12G plan as the "welcome" offer, Mint Mobile used Fedex and shipped from CA to NJ within 2 days.

The package includes two green envelopes, one has a single SIM card with the plan you purchased, the other one has two SIM cards that you can send as a gift to your friends. I'm not sure if Mint Mobile always send out the "gift" SIM cards, but it is nice gift for sharing (Only if the SIM works, more detail in [Onboarding Process & Get a New Number](#onboarding-process--get-a-new-number)).
