> Do you want to pay only $15 as person for your wireless bill each month? If "Yes", please keep reading.
 
[Mint Mobile](https://www.mintmobile.com/) initially starts on August 1, 2016. It started gaining massive attraction during the Super Bowl commercial in 2018 with a "green fox" talking about saving money on phone plan with only $20 a month.

## Initial Thoughts
At the time of writing this article, assume you only want to pay for a single line, you'd see the following price from major carriers. You can get even lower price if you are in a family plan with multiple people, so it is something we need to take into consideration compared with Mint Mobile. Note: the price below gives you unlimited talk, text & data.
 
|  AT&T  | Verizon | T-Mobile | Sprint |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|
| $65/mo  | $70/mo   | $60/mo   | $60/mo  |
 
At first glance, Mint Mobile's plans are very competitive on the price. Although users have to plan on how much data they would need beforehand (Mint Mobile is not unlimited on 4G), it's still sounds like a good deal from the money perspective. 
 
Secondly, users pay their contract fee upfront with Mint Mobile, it feels like prepaid monthly plan. There are 9 options available now: 3, 6 and 12 months, each month you can choose 3G, 8G and 12G as 4G data plan, both talks and text are unlimited, the longer period you have the less monthly cost you pay. 
 
With a winter (Black Friday) deal, you could get your first 3 months with 12G data as low as $15/month. After 3 month "welcome" contract period, you can choose to close the account, change plan or continue with the current plan. Despite the plan you choose, at the beginning of each plan cycle, you pay for the entire contract instead of a monthly installment. For example, if you choose a 12 month plan, you'd need to pay for the entire year, which could be a burden compared to other wireless carriers.
 
Thirdly, as a wireless provider, signal is one of the biggest factors need to take careful consideration. Mint Mobile is powered by T-Mobile's 4G LTE network, how good is that? It depends where you go but overall I am happy with my experience.
 
At last, Mint Mobile doesn't sell your phone with their plan, it is called **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**, which means you'd need to bring an unlocked phone yourself. If you are not sure if your phone is unlocked, please check your current wireless provider before making the purchase.
 
Since I need to purchase a cheap phone plan for less than 6 months, I am curious, I'd give Mint Mobile a try, below is my review within 7 days experience. 
 
## Ordering & Unboxing Process
I had a very good experience with their website and order process is straightforward, they also take the shipping cost away due to the deal which is very nice. I paid chose the $15/month for first 3 months with 12G plan as the "welcome" offer, Mint Mobile used Fedex and shipped from CA to NJ within 2 days.
 
The package includes two green envelopes, one has a single SIM card with the plan you purchased, the other one has two SIM cards that you can send as a gift to your friends. I'm not sure if Mint Mobile always send out the "gift" SIM cards, but it is nice gift for sharing (Only if the SIM works, more detail in [Onboarding Process & Get a New Number](#onboarding-process--get-a-new-number)).

## Activation Process
Mint Mobile has an easy way to activate the SIM card [online](https://my.mintmobile.com/activation), you just need to provie the ACT Code on the back of the card, then follow the instructions online. Since I only need a new number, all I need is to choose a zip code and they generate a phone number for you. _Note: if you live in city like New York and keep the number for limit time, you might want to choose an area that's less crowded, my one bad experience is spam call starts on day 1!_

One small issue I had was the SIM card carried my 12G plan was a bad SIM one, which I tried on different 3 phones, all phones said "No SIM Card Found". I called Mint Mobile, the representative kept saying my phone was locked. Then I switched to the "gift" SIM card which showed "No signal", I called Mint Mobile again and told them more detail, they swapped the SIM card associated with my plan, problem solved! 
 
Another issue I encountered was I initially don't have 4G data available. After resetting network on my iPhone 6, everything seems to be working smoothly. I am in Mint network!
 
## Mint Mobile UI
You can interact with Mint Mobile by web, app and text message. I am impressed by its UI. It is clean and clear, it has all the information I need as a wireless plan, renew the plan is very simple, add more data is just a few buttons click, it even provides a useful button to check my remaining 4G data of a month.

## Signal Test
I'd say signal is acceptable in my test, I have my AT&T at home with 2 out of 4 signal bars and Mint Mobile has 1-2 out of 4 signal bar. I went to Whole Food market in NJ during last weekend, both carriers had a hard time to get any signal, Mint Mobile is not impressive at this point.
 
## Summary
In summary, I think Mint Mobile is very smart in the wireless market. It focuses on a very different segments than its competitors.
 
I think it is a great product for the following needs:
- For travellers only need to be in the US for a limited time without worrying about signing a wireless contract.
- Users use less data than unlimited or have access to WIFI most of time.
- Users bring their own phone.
