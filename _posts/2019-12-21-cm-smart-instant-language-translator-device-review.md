CM Smart Instant Language Translator Device ("CM translator" for short) is a Microsoft AI powered, 42 languages supported, superior battery life device. The CM translator got 2019 the "iF Design Award" and it is very appealing at the first impression. I recently purchased one of this device on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VH2BLDM/) at $84.99 (original price $129.99), it has 4.6 stars out of 5. CM translator is produced by a Chinese company called Cheetah Mobile ("猎豹移动"), its [official website](https://xiaobao.cmcm.com/fanyibang/?f=www) has a different version than the one from Amazon, the one from its official website is CNY ¥299 ($42.82) but only supports 20 languages.
 
The purpose of this purchase is mainly for my parents who don't speak English, I hope this device can reduce barriers for them to communicate while they are traveling. Before I made this purchase, I learned the following from Amazon website about this product: 
- You have to connect with your phone via bluetooth for CM translator to work.
- Although it is said 42 languages, but you can only have 2 languages selected while using. To change the language you need to reset and download the language package on your phone. However, most of the time you only have 2 languages in one conversion.
- CM Smart Instant Language Translator Device is good for travel and it is good for simple sentences for now. Don't have high expectations before purchase, complex words or sentences may disappoint you.
 
## Unboxing
The box is very light and follow with a simple design. On the side it said "1-Key transaction * 180 Days Endurance".

## Onboarding Process
As CM translator needs to connect to a phone with internet connection to start working, we first need to download CheetahTalk from [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheetahtalk/id1455328572) or [Andorid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhytek.itranslator&hl=en_US).
 
Once you open the App, you should be able to choose the languages you want to perform translation. Switching to different language requires upgrading firmware, the app takes 1~2 minutes to finish this process.

## Translation Core
As I only speak English and Mandarin, my test experience was based on those two languages. I have tested the CM translator for last 7 days and want to share my overall experience.
 
### External View
*Score: 5/5*

As the winner of "iF Design Award" in 2019, CM translator has only one button. You only need to hold that button while you speak or listen to someone else speak. 
 
### Voice collection & recognition
*Score: 4/5*

I am happy about the voice collection & recognition part in general. However, since you cannot choose the language you actually speak, if there is a word sounds similar in another language, it might recognize as other words, but it doesn't happen often.
 
### Translation Speed
*Score: 3.5/5*

Overall, the speed is good, and depends on the length of the sentence and your internet connection speed. The process actually collect your voice -> speech to word process -> get the translation back from Microsoft AI -> Speak back to you
For simple sentences, for example, "I like eating chili peppers", it takes 4~5 seconds. I don't expect this to be under 1 second but that's OK to hold the conversion without too much silence.
 
### Translation Accuracy
*Score: 4/5* 

This is my only concern. If the translation quality is bad, it doesn't matter how many design awards it won, user won't even consider it. CM translator is accurate in the majority of the words and sentences, thanks to its backbone Microsoft AI. However, some translation may not be accurate with simple words, for example, **prune juice**, it tried to translate "prune" as a verb instead of a noun, so it would be wired in another language. In my experience, it is 85% accurate and some translations are very impressive. As CM translator partnership with Microsoft AI service, the improvement of the translation quality should be promising in the future.

### Voice
*Score: 3.5/5* 

The sound is quite loud and you can change it in setting. However, You won't be able to change the voice at this version and the Voice sounds like another "Siri", however, it feels like "Siri" in a rush. I didn't see a way you can change the speed of how the translation get back to you, which is not good for people to learn a language. I'd definitely say it is a feature request for CM translator.
 
## Summary
The CM translator is a promising product, you don't have to hold your phone with loud speaker close to other's mouth. It's super easy to use with one button click. With around a hundred dollars, this nice looking device to help you travel and learn another language, I'd definitely recommend using it.
