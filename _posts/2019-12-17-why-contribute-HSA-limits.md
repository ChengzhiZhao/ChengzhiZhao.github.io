## Health Savings Account Overview
> [Health Savings Account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) is a tax-advantaged medical savings account available to taxpayers in the United States who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). -- Wikipedia

HSA first starts on December 8, 2003, it was designed as a replacement for medical savings account ([MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_savings_account_(United_States)), which mostly target for self-employed or small corporations. HSA empowers savings in multiple ways, we will talk more detail in [Power of HSA](#power-of-hsa) 

### Prerequisite
Similar as MSA, HSA is coupled with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), which usually has lower premium monthly payment, but costs more than traditional insurance plan to reach to deductible for insurance to kick in. 

### Restriction
HSA is health related account, you can use and only use it for health related cost, otherwise you will pay the penalty. However, you can refer to this long **[CARE ELIGIBILITY LIST]**(http://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/learning-center/irs-qualified-medical-expenses), it covers more than you think as health care related expense.
