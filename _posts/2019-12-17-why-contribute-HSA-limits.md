Regretly, Health Savings Account(HSA) has never been in my personal finance radar until recently. Three years ago, I did put money into HSA but use it as Flexible Spending Account(FSA), I repent that I never treat HSA as an investment tool to do any investment. Until recently, I learned all the pros and cons of using HSA, I find out HSA is one of the best investment tool available. it's very powerful and I am eager to share everything I learned. If you want to find out more about the beauty of HSA, and gain more knowledge and insights about HSA, please keep reading!

## Health Savings Account Overview
> [Health Savings Account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) is a tax-advantaged medical savings account available to taxpayers in the United States who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). -- Wikipedia

HSA first starts on December 8, 2003, it was designed as a replacement for medical savings account ([MSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_savings_account_(United_States)), which mostly target for self-employed or small corporations. HSA empowers savings in multiple ways, we will talk more detail in [Power of HSA](#power-of-hsa) 

### Prerequisite
Similar as MSA, HSA is coupled with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), which usually has lower premium monthly payment, but costs more than traditional insurance plan to reach to deductible for insurance to kick in. 

### Restriction
HSA is health related account, you can use and only use it for health related cost, otherwise you will pay the penalty. However, you can refer to this long [CARE ELIGIBILITY LIST](http://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/learning-center/irs-qualified-medical-expenses), it covers more than you think as health care related expense.

## Health Savings Account(HSA) vs. Flexible Spending Account(FSA)
While HSA is account for health expense, FSA, which stands for "Flexible Spending Account" is another option for health expense. Most employers will give some options to their employees to choose from, we can compare from multiple perspectives:

- Federal Pre-tax contribution: both are same.
- Individual Contribution limit: FSA is $2,750, HSA is $3,550 in year 2020.
- Rollover: FSA you'd able to rollover $500 in unused funds to next plan year. HSA is not restricted on it.
- Investment: No on FSA, Yes on HSA.
- Reimbursement (Out of pocket claims): If you pay something in cash or credit card for health expense and want to get reimbursement, that money goes back to FSA balance, HSA you can reimburse directly to your bank account. 
- Health insurance plan: you can have FSA under a traditional health plan, HSA you have to choose HDHP.


## Power of HSA
We actually spoiled some benefits on HSA already in the previous section, but we shall review them in great detail:

### Tax free contribution
Besides 401K, HSA is another great option for people to contribute your money **"Tax Free"**. HSA is not subject to federal tax. For state tax:
  - If you live in state with no state tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Of course, you won't gain or lose anything
  - If you live in California or New Jersey. Sorry :(, you still have to pay state tax on it, as HSA is treated regular brokerage account.
  - If you live other states than above, you are good to save state tax as well.
Overall, it is nearly as good as 401K to lower your tax bucket. Additionally, some company may even contribute to your HSA as well, try to find out if you company do so, at least you should try to get the part that company matches.

### Investment
A hidden gem for HSA is you can do investment. Don't be scared about the idea of investing your health related cost to stock market or mutual fund. It's like 401K, you choose a reliable fund and invest for long term. Depends on your age, health and risk tolerant, you will have different investment strategies. If you want to super aggressive, you can put all your money in stock market; If you just want to be safe, you can even put it like a saving account to earn interest monthly. Some HSA funds may have large cost ratio, make sure you read each before you put money in. For long term investment, if you put $3,550 every year, with 7% yearly return rate, 20 years later, you'd have 
$145,615.99, with $74,575.99 interest gained.

### Tax-free Earnings
If you invest and don't need to worry about paying tax on interest and dividends, it sounds like ROTH? Yes, Earnings in HSA are tax-free! Except if you are in New Hampshire and Tennessee, in those states you need to double check state laws on how you can deduct your earnings. For other states, from the calculation in the investment section, that's $74,575.99 free of tax. REMEMBER -- Only for health expense.

### Rollover
This is mainly for the comparison of other accounts like FSA. You don't have to rush to spend all your money in HSA. One downside of some HSAs are like checking account, they require monthly contributions or minimum balance, otherwise their management fee could eat your pie.

### Usage Scope
We already mentioned that there is a long [CARE ELIGIBILITY LIST](http://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/learning-center/irs-qualified-medical-expenses). But you can also use HSA for people is not your health insurance. For example, you can buy some HSA-eligible vitamin for your parents without having them on the insurance plan.

### Defer medication reimbursement
If you have a medical bill and you have enough cash to pay the bill, you can choose to pay the bill directly by cash or credit card now, then you save the receipts (I usually scan the receipts and have a folder in Dropbox for those expense), those receipts will be reimburse later. You might ask why? As we discussed in [The Art of Compound Interest](https://moneynotebooks.com/personal%20finance/the-art-compound-interest/), you can let time play its role, your investment in HSA will be compounding more since you won't touch the principle. Eventually, you will submit those receipts to get that money reimbursed, but that would be the money with long time compounding.

## Summary
I hope this article gives your some insights on how powerful HSA is. It is one of the investment tool has been underestimated. Don't be scared away from health care only or HDHP, read through more details and plan carefully with your financial situation. If you are healthy and don't hit the deductible of the your health insurance every year. Definitely, you should consider evaluate HSA as an option or even max out HSA contribution yearly.
