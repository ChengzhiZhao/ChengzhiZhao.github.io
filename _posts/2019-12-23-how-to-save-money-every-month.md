Getting paid is an exciting moment, living paycheck to paycheck is not good for retirement, this article may help you to build a habit of saving and find your ways convert expense to wealth.
Think about your financial situation now, If you spend more than earn and have a hard time to keep borrowing money, you are not alone. In 2019, according to a recent survey from [Charles Schwab](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/Charles-Schwab-2019-Modern-Wealth-Survey-findings-0519-9JBP.pdf),
> "59% of U.S. adults saying they live paycheck to paycheck, 44% usually carry a credit card balance or struggle to keep up with bills/payments, $483 average non-essential spending each month."
 
## Why do I need to save?
 
You may argue that life is short, the money you earned should be spent 100% for fun. But..Do you really need to spend 100% of your income? Have you ever thought about retirement, your kids or losing job? Life is short, and full of adventures. If you don’t have a backup plan, or at least a second choice, the road won’t be paved easily for you.
 
Saving money is a good habit. If you have read the book [The Millionaire Next Door](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Americas/dp/1589795474), which shows you the spending and saving habits that lead to more cash than most people earn in their life, you’d find very interesting that in the book, most of the millionaire won’t look like rich from their appearance; on the other hand, people struggle in finance would pretend to be rich and buy all luxury goods than they can actually afford. Once you have the saving habit, you are in autopilot mode to making additional money into investment. Saving is a critical step to financial independence, the biggest issue is **"People spend too much than they earned"**. You should examinate your living expenses first, then start saving.
 
## Go though your living expense
 
### Collect Data
The traditional way is to run through your monthly expense, including all credit card, rent/mortgage, car, groceries, meals etc, put them into a spreadsheet and categorize each items. If spreadsheet sounds like old style, there are Apps help you monitor your expense to give an idea about how much you spend every month. Apps like [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) or [Clarity Money](https://www.marcus.com/us/en/clarity-money) allow you to give each transaction a tag or category. I personally found Mint is good overall, but Clarity Money has a nice feature to identify recurring bills which is great to cut your monthly expenses.
 
### Student Loan/Personal Loan
Carrying a student loan or even personal loan is stressful, if you carry those types of loans, it is hard to save while having those types of loans as the interest would swallow your gain.
- Rule 1: Prioritize to pay them off.
- Rule 2: Refer to rule 1.
 
### Housing(Rent/Mortgage) Expense
How much housing bill you should pay monthly? It depends. One famous formula is “30% Rule”, which is the maximum you should put on housing is 30% of gross monthly income (before taxes). If you make $10,000 annually, the max you can put on renting is $2,500. However, $2,500 in New York City is different than $2,500 in Austin in the housing market; Also, sometimes rent could be more affordable, sometimes purchasing a permanent house is an economic choice. Don't use this rule  strictly but it should give you some ideas on whether you spend more than your income for housing. If you spend "50%" of your total income in housing, you might want to consider a roommate if you are single or downsize your housing as an option, or even move to an affordable area.
 
### Car/Commute Expense
People also develop a "20/4/10 ratio" rule to help with car purchase. This rule is you put at least 20% down with a loan for 4 years, and you monthly expense on car including loan, insurance and other expenses is lower than 10% of your monthly income (pre-tax). Except the antique car, car is usually considered as liability, you shouldn't put too much of your income into liability than assets like investment. If you are spending over 10% of your monthly income on car loan or commute expense, it is too high, you should consider trying to trade in a reliable but cheaper car, ride a bike or take public transportation. Ask HR to see if your company has those commute benefits which is pre-tax and it could save you some expense on transportation too.
 
### Meal
Cooking at home is definitely going to be healthier and cheaper. However, it takes time to prepare food and cook. If you are OK with eating the same dish for the entire week, you should explore meal prep as an option, which you save time during weekdays but you’d need to spend an entire Sunday afternoon cooking for the rest of the week. If you live in a big city like Chicago or New York, you can also checkout [Mealpal](https://www.mealpal.com/), it is a subscription business for you to pick up food from a list of restaurants nearby during lunch or dinner time, and it's also reasonably cheap; But the food size may be different than you order directly from the restaurant, it's a good way to save money on meal while you have dozens of options to choose from.
 
### Grocery Shopping
Grocery shopping can be expensive if you try to purchase more than you could consume. Also, if you go grocery shopping every day, it could be more expensive than going weekly. It is because grocery stores try to keep you with their promotion, and you end up buying more daily than going to grocery stores weekly. Building a list of grocery items and buy thing only on that list is a strategy. Coupon from your mailbox is two sides of a coin, there are a lot of discount if you really need that items; however, purchasing the essential item vs. potato chips are different, you may spend more than you originally planned.
 
### Others
There could be many other expenses in your living expenses, evaluate them to see if you really need them. Use App like [Clarity Money](https://www.marcus.com/us/en/clarity-money) to track recurring cost and identify the one you pay monthly but seldom use.
