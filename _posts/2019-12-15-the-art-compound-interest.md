The word "Compound Interest" is powerful and give a person enough imagination related to wealth, finance independent and happy life. Back to reality, compound interest doesn't always come with happy ending. As Einstein wiesly stated, compound interest is like "two sides of a coin": people who understand and utilize it, may use it as a investment vehicle to gain more money; people who don't understand and utilize it, may play a role like a lamb to the slaughter. You may gain money by investing with compound interest, you may owe money and pay montly bills with compound interest. 

The basic of compound interest is very important to everyone, it sets the foundation for investment; it also can also help you to avoid sales trap.

### Compound Interest 101

Compound interest is not a complex with simple formula: 

> [p (1 + i)^n]

p = principal
i = interest rate
n = number of compounding periods

With internet, you don't have to run away with Math and we don't have to apply Excel calculation as well, there are tons of website or app help you caculate compound interest for you. The one calculator I like is [COMPOUND INTEREST CALCULATOR](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator)

Now let's start with an example. For example, Mike has $1,000 dollors to invest, he put the money in a "fancy bank" with a 8% interest guarantee rate annually. After one year, he would have `1,000 * (1+5%)^1 = 1,080` as the final result. Without touching the initial $1000, he'd earn $80 pretax after one year, that's good enough for him to have a nice dinner or purchase a new video game!

However, Mike decides to continue without having that nice dinner or buying a new video game. For the start of next year, the principal become $1,080 instead of $1000, which is $80 more participate in the next round of interest compounding!

Applied same caculation, Mike would got $1,166.40 at the end of year 2! Now, with the additional $166.40, Mike could treat himself with a Michelin dinner or 3 video games!

Mike keep going without get his earned interested earned, which means he keep investing with the interest. Time flies, after 20 years, without taking any money out from the Bank, Mike would got $4,660.96 with his only $1,000 investment, which is 4.6 times than his initial investment. Impressive, isn't it!
