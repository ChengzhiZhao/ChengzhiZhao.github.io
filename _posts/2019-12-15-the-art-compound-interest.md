### Compound Interest 101

Compound interest is not a complex with simple formula: 

> [p (1 + i)^n]

p = principal
i = interest rate
n = number of compounding periods

For example, let's say Mike has $1000 dollors to invest, he put the money in a bank with 8% interest rate annually. After one year, he would have `1000 * (1+5%)^1 = 1080` as the final result. Without touching the initial $1000, he'd earn $80 pretax after one year, that's good enough for him to have a nice dinner or purchase a new video game!
