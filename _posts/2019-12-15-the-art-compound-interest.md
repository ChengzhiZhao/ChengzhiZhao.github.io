> Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it. <cite><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he">Albert Einstein</a></cite>

The word **"Compound Interest"** is powerful and give a person enough imagination related to wealth, finance independent and happy life. Back to reality, compound interest doesn't always come with happy ending. As Einstein wiesly stated, compound interest is like "two sides of a coin": people who understand and utilize it, may use it as a investment vehicle to gain more money; people who don't understand and utilize it, may play a role like a lamb to the slaughter. You may gain money by investing with compound interest, you may owe money and pay montly bills with compound interest. 

The basic of compound interest is very important to everyone, it sets the foundation for investment; it also can also help you to avoid sales trap.

## Compound Interest 101

Compound interest is not a complex with simple formula: 

> [p (1 + i)^n]

p = principal

i = interest rate

n = number of compounding periods or time

With internet, you don't have to run away with Math and we don't have to apply Excel calculation as well, there are tons of website or app help you caculate compound interest for you. The one calculator I like is [COMPOUND INTEREST CALCULATOR](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator)

Now let's start with an example. For example, Mike has $1,000 dollors to invest, he put the money in a "fancy bank" with a 8% interest guarantee rate annually. After one year, he would have **`1,000 * (1+5%)^1 = 1,080`** as the final result. Without touching the initial $1000, he'd earn $80 pretax after one year, that's good enough for him to have a nice dinner or purchase a new video game!

However, Mike decides to continue without having that nice dinner or buying a new video game. For the start of next year, the principal become $1,080 instead of $1000, which is $80 more participate in the next round of interest compounding!

Applied same caculation, Mike would got $1,166.40 at the end of year 2! Now, with the additional $166.40, Mike could treat himself with a Michelin dinner or 3 video games!

Mike keep going without get his earned interested earned, which means he keep investing with the interest. Time flies, after 20 years, without taking any money out from the Bank, Mike would got **$4,660.96** with his only $1,000 investment, which is **4.6** times than his initial investment. Impressive, isn't it!

You should note here, there are a few factors are very critical in this compound interest calculation:

1. Time is the most important factor in the equation, it is a powerful number and the secret why money grows exponentially. invest 1 year ($1,080) vs. 20($4,660.96) years makes huge difference. 
2. Mike didn't make a decision to take the money out every year. If he pulled the interest earned out every year, let's do the caculation again, **$80 interest earned every year* 20 years = 1600 plus initial $1000**, the total would be $2,600, which is **$4,660.96 - $2,600 = 2060.96** less than without taking the money out every year. You could argue that he'd lose the opportunity to spend $80 for fun in life, which could be endless argument as everyone has different lifestyle. 
3. Principle or the initial money you put is important, but in compounding calculation, time can pay for even less principle. To see one example, you can fast forward to an [Example](#time-value-factor).
4. The "Fancy Bank" with 8% interest rate is hard to find, as market fluctuate, we just use it as an example.

## Time Value Factor
Let's still use Mike as an example, and introduce Gary to compare with Mike's strategy. We shall keep the "fancy bank" as fancy as it is with a 8% interest guarantee rate annually. 

> Mike keeps his original investment plan, which he put $1,000, leave in the bank for 20 years, the final money he has in bank is $4,660.96

> Gary wants to use same strategy as Mike's when Mike has already invested his $1,000 for 10 years. Gary has extra money, so he put $2,000, leave in the bank for 10 years, the final money he has in bank is $4,317.85

Wait...Gary even doubles the inital priciple won't catch up with Mike? The answer is because of compound interest, Mike actually had $2158.92 already in the bank at year 10 when Gary starts, the begining fund of Mike is more than Gary's fund $2,000.

## The other side of the coin
Everything sounds great so far as compound interest is decent way to gain more money. The other side of the coin is: if others use compound interest on you, it would become really hard to escape from the mire of debt. 

One example is credit card, if you only pay the minimum payment each month, you'd be surprise to find out how much more money you actually paid for. Let's use another example, Tony wants to purchase a new laptop which costs $1,000, he doesn't have enough cash to pay in advance, so he decides to borrow the money and use credit card to pay for the new laptop. 

The laptop was very new and has all the features Tony need. However, since Tony don't have enough cash, he pays what is called **"the minimum payment"** of his credit card. According to [Wallethub](https://wallethub.com/edu/cc/average-credit-card-interest-rate/50841/), The average credit card interest rate is 19.21%. Although paying the *minimum payment* won't trigger any penalty on your credit history, the $1,000 that Tony borrowed initally won't be free money. 

Every monthly, Tony keeps paying minimum payment, As he carry some balance month to month, each payment would split into two portions (calculation detail depends on how the credit card issuer calculate):
- First, the interest he owed to the bank.
{: .notice--danger}
- Secondly, less interest, the remaining part from minimum payment applied to priciple.
{: .notice--danger}

What does It mean? To visualize it, let's assume Tony has a credit card with 20% interest, he pays $35 as minimum payment. It would take him 3 years and 4 months to pay off the laptop, and also will pay $369 addition for compound interest.

As the interest on credit card is usually very high, it is exceedingly costly in the long run, you can see how compound interest in this case add pressure to Tony's life. If you can plan better and avoid carrying balance on a credit card, I strongly suggest you do so.

## The bottom line
Compound interest is powerful if you put into investment than debt. As you can see, properly using this investment vehicle can gain you in much better financial state. Investment is a recurring event, you don't have to wait until you have a good income stream or promotion, start today, it is a habit that worth running in long term. Remember, **TIME** is your unique and most valuation asset.
