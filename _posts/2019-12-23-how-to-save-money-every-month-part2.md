In this part of the post, we are going to discuss ways to save and invest in this article. If you’d want to refer to the previous one about reviewing your living expenses, Please check out this ["How to start saving money when you get paid? (Part 1)"](https://moneynotebooks.com/personal%20finance/how-to-save-money-every-month-part1/). 

## Pre-tax retirement plan
If your company offers a pre-tax retirement plan, for example, traditional 401(k) or 403(b), particularly the company matches your contribution, you should definitely consider putting down money toward it. The max you can contribute to traditional 401(k) or 403(b) alone is $19,500 in 2020. One benefit you should prioritize putting your money into a plan like 401(k) is first you pay no taxes on the contributions; second, investment gains, interest or dividends are also tax-free. But you’d need to pay tax when you need the money for your retirement, however, your tax bucket at that time would be lower since your income would be much lower after you retired.

## After-tax retirement plan
Roth 401(k) is one of the example of the after-tax retirement plan, the limit alone is $19,500 in 2020. So you would still pay the taxes, social security, medical, also investment gains, interest or dividends are tax-free as traditional 401(k). But you won’t need to pay taxes when you withdraw the money during retirement. 

**Important Note**: You can contribute to both traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k), but the total of your contributions cannot exceed $19,500 in 2020. How you want to divide each portion depends on your retirement target and plan. 

## HSA and FSA
Healthcare saving should be an important component when you start a saving journey. Both HSA and FSA are great to save pre-tax money for your medical or healthcare-related expenses. Depends on your health condition and expenses on healthcare every year, you may want to choose HSA vs. FSA differently.
HSA is a powerful investment vehicle, I have mentioned the benefit and how to use HSA in my previous post [“Why You Should Consider Contributing Maximum of Health Savings Account(HSA)”](https://moneynotebooks.com/personal%20finance/why-contribute-HSA-limits/). If you are in a traditional health plan and can spend more than $500 (rollover limit for FSA) on healthcare expenses, you should consider funding FSA to save your bill on taxes and social tax.

## Emergency Fund
You should have a checking or savings account with 3 - 6 months’ expense as an emergency fund, which helps you in case of an emergency like losing jobs, having an accident or any situation that you need cash right away. In most cases, you don’t want to touch your retirement fund before you retired. The emergency fund is the first stop you will ask for additional money from, so make sure if you “borrow” money from your emergency fund, you have to pay it back before any other types of investment or savings. This is likely to be the first you’d do before even start investing as it gives you some buffer to face the bad financial situation.

## Mutual Fund.
Buying mutual funds involve with great discussion, there are thousands of options you can choose from. If you don’t have time to invest or study investment, Warren Buffett recommends the average investor S&P500 index fund. He also said at his annual shareholder's meeting in 2002, “If I were going to put money into an index fund in relatively equal amounts over a 20 or 30-year period, I would pick a fund — and I know Vanguard has very low costs. ”. Take 10% or more of your income toward S&P500 index funds (you can set up withdrawing automatically), and keep doing the money there for 20 or 30 years, even the market is down, don’t take it out. Leave it there and pretend you total forget you know you have that money. The dividend and capital gains will prove themselves that you made the right decision.

## Stock
If you want to outperform the market massively like Warren Buffet or Peter Lynch, this might be the option with high risk but high returns. The market has been in bullish for over 10 years since 2009, no one knows when the next downtime could be, so be cautious about your portfolio if you are not an expert in this area.

## The bottom line
I haven’t talked about investments like real estate, as I believe it requires it is not suitable for our topic about saving money after getting paid. In Summary, saving doesn’t require you to be smart, on the other hand, you probably need to be “dumb”, which you need to be consistent with your decision and keep following it. Try to find a way to cut your monthly bills/payment as we discussed in part1, and keep putting money that can generate more money. Once you have this habit, you will feel much better in your retirement life.
